## ‚öôÔ∏è Tests

After starts the [SpringBootApplication](https://github.com/gabrielhgcamargo/cadastro-nota-restful-api/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/gabrielhgcamargo/NotaAlunoApplication.java):

### :computer: Test using swagger

You can acess:

> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

You will can see all controllers, what they do and how to do the HTTP Methods, in the correct order.

### :bookmark_tabs: Test using Postman

Order of the commands is important:

```
POST - http://localhost:8080/api/users

Register a User to use the HTTP Methods. ID is AUTO-INCREMENT.
To 'Teacher' permissions, use True on the field 'admin'. To 'student', use false.
Teacher role can use all HTTP methods, and Student role can just save a new student in AlunoController.

Body

{
    "login": "name",
    "password": "anyPassword",
    "admin": true
}


Response

{
    "id": 1,
    "login": "sandro",
    "password": "$2a$10$aNOibCB3wbp9se.CJa37wOUxXqoTYbQn0QJP53B3bIp3t/HlHYZzS",
    "admin": true
}

STATUS: 201 CREATED

```
Now, with a user registered, you can register some student:
And do not forget to in Authorization in Postman, choose 'Basic Auth', and insert your Login/Password. To all HTTP Methods below...

```
POST - http://localhost:8080/api/student/save

Body

{
    "nome" : "Gabriel Camargo",
    "dataNascimento" : "2000-12-31"
}


Response

{
    "id": 1,
    "nome": "Gabriel Camargo",
    "dataNascimento": "2000-12-31"
}

STATUS: 201 CREATED

```

Now, with a student registered, you can get informations with the ID generated:

```
GET - http://localhost:8080/api/student/1

Response

{
    "id": 1,
    "nome": "Gabriel Camargo",
    "dataNascimento": "2000-12-31"
}

STATUS: 200 OK

```
To update the informations from the student:

```

Body

{
    "nome" : "Rafael",
    "dataNascimento" : "2004-04-26"
}


Response

STATUS: 200 OK

```
To get all students in a list, or use Params (like a filter):

```
GET - http://localhost:8080/api/student

Response

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "nome": "Rafael",
        "dataNascimento": "2004-04-26"
    }
]

STATUS: 200 OK

```

To delete some student:

```
DELETE - http://localhost:8080/api/student/1

Response

```

Now, with a student registered, it is possible to insert the grades:

```
POST - http://localhost:8080/api/grades/

Body

{
    "codigo": 10,
    "aluno": 1, // --> STUDENT ID
    "nota1": 2,
    "nota2": 4
}


Response

10

STATUS: 201 CREATED

```
Now, we can get the informations about the student, grades and status:

```
GET - http://localhost:8080/api/grades/10

Response

{
    "codigo": 10,
    "id_aluno": 1,
    "nome": "Rafael",
    "dataNascimento": "26/04/2004",
